### Initial Outreach to Support Companies

```
Subject: Reducing Linux Support Tickets by 40% at [Company Name]

Dear [Name],

I noticed [Company] provides Linux support services to [target industry/clients]. 

We've developed a tool called Linux Command Translator that's helping support providers reduce command-related tickets by 30-40%. Companies like [reference if available] are using it to:

• Decrease time spent on basic command support
• Improve first-call resolution rates
• Enable junior support staff to handle more complex issues

Our proprietary DNA-based security technology ensures all commands are properly validated before execution, reducing risk for your clients.

Do you have 15 minutes this week to see how this might benefit your support operation? I'd be happy to show you a quick demo specifically customized for support teams.

Best regards,
