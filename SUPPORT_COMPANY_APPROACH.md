## Approach Strategy

### Research Phase
1. **Company-specific research**
   - Current Linux distributions supported
   - Client industries and typical use cases
   - Support tiers and service levels
   - Current tools and technology stack

2. **Contact identification**
   - Map organization structure using LinkedIn
   - Identify decision makers in support operations
   - Look for innovation or partnership teams
   - Find technical champions through forums/communities

### Initial Contact Methods

1. **Direct outreach**
   - Email template for support directors (see PARTNERSHIP_OUTREACH.md)
   - LinkedIn connection requests with context
   - Phone call script for support operations leaders
   - Follow-up sequence (3 touches over 2 weeks)

2. **Warm introduction path**
   - Through technology partners (Red Hat, Canonical)
   - Through client introductions
   - Via industry events and meetups
   - Through investor/advisor networks

3. **Content-led engagement**
   - "State of Linux Support Efficiency" report
   - Webinar on reducing support ticket volume
   - Case study with support metrics

### First Meeting Strategy

1. **Discovery questions**
   - "How many Linux-related tickets do you handle monthly?"
   - "What's the experience breakdown of your support team?"
   - "What's your average resolution time for command issues?"
   - "How do you currently help clients with Linux commands?"
   - "What percentage of tickets are for basic command help?"

2. **Demonstration focus**
   - Support ticket resolution scenario
   - Junior staff empowerment use case
   - Client self-service portal option
   - Integration with ticketing system

3. **Objection handling**
   - "Our team already knows Linux commands" → Focus on consistency and time savings

   - "It's too expensive" → Walk through ROI calculation
   - "Security concerns" → Explain DNA-based watermarking
