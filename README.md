## Created by Ervin Remus Radosavlevici

A web application that translates natural language queries into Linux terminal commands. This tool helps users who are unfamiliar with command-line syntax to easily find and execute the right Linux commands for their needs.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts plain English queries into Linux commands
- **Real Command Execution**: Safely executes Linux commands directly within the application
- **Safety Validation**: Checks commands for safety and provides risk level indicators
- **Command Breakdown**: Explains each part of the generated command
- **Command History**: Saves previous queries for easy reuse
- **DNA-based Security**: Includes proprietary watermarking and security features
- **Copyright Protection**: Built-in security measures to protect intellectual property

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Bootstrap
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o for natural language processing
- **Security**: Custom DNA-based watermarking and authentication

## Usage

1. Enter a natural language query (e.g., "list all files in current directory")
2. View the translated Linux command, explanation, and breakdown
3. Use the "Execute" button to run the command and see real results
4. Copy commands to clipboard as needed
5. Access command history for previously used commands

## Installation & Setup
