                    <h3 class="h5">How It Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        LinuxTranslator uses advanced natural language processing powered by OpenAI's models to understand your request and generate the appropriate Linux command. Each command is:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Analyzed for safety and security concerns</li>
                        <li>Watermarked with a unique DNA-based identifier</li>
                        <li>Provided with a detailed explanation</li>
                        <li>Added to your local history for future reference</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        We take security seriously. Each command is validated before being presented to you, and our DNA-based watermarking system ensures authenticity and ownership. Your command history is stored locally in your browser, not on our servers.
